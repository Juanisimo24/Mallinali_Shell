  - "\u2026A spirit\u2026 still listens\u2026? Please\u2026 stay your blade\u2026
    I mean no harm."
  - Who speaks? Show yourself!
  - "I am called Malinalli, once guardian of this jungle\u2026 now only a whisper
    of what I was."
  - "I\u2026 have slept for so long. My body is broken, my strength scattered across
    this cursed land."
  - "A spirit turtle\u2026? Why call to me? I have battles of my own."
  - "Because I can feel your heart trembling like the roots of the world. You have
    lost much\u2026 haven\u2019t you, warrior?"
  - "Your grief sings through the earth itself. I\u2026 I know that pain."
  - "My village\u2026 gone. Everything burned. I hunt those responsible."
  - "Then perhaps our fates are intertwined. Those who defiled your home\u2026 they
    shattered me too. My shell cracked under their corruption."
  - "Help me rise again, and I will guide you. I can sense what eyes cannot \u2014
    spirits, memories, hidden paths beneath the veil of this world."
  - "You ask for my help, spirit\u2026 but why should I trust you?"
  - Because even gods fear to walk alone.
  - "I cannot fight as I once did\u2026 but beside you, I can lend my strength, my
    wisdom\u2026 and perhaps, redemption."
  - "Tell me, warrior\u2026 what name should I call you by, so the spirits may know
    who walks beside me?"
  - "Then rise, (name), and walk with me. I will be your shell, your shield\u2026
    and you, my blade."
  - "Together, we may mend what was broken \u2014 or perish as one trying."
